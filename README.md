The files above can be run sequentially to obtain lists of variants with PS1, PM5, and PVS1 evidence. Contents in /clinvar_only/ and /dbnsfp_catalog/ are for obtaining VUS variants within ClinVar and unclassified variants exome-wide with ACMG/AMP evidence, respectively. ClinVar variant summary .txt files should be run through the processor in /general/, then used to run subsequent files in /preprocessing/ and /analysis/ folders in this specific order. Replace all file paths with appropriate local file paths, and keep in mind that outputs from one file are often used in subsequent files. Using a similar file path structure and similar file names are suggested. 

A far simpler and smaller set of files to obtain similar lists of variants are available in /simple/. However, amino acid substitutions are not verified to be the same or in the same codon for PS1 and PM5 evidences, consequences are not checked for all evidence tiers, and unclassified variants from dbNSFP cannot be matched by transcript for PS1 and PM5 evidence. It is recommended to use this set of files when ease of running is a priority and when additional annotations are not needed, and it is recommended to use the main set of files when having the most accurate data with all annotations is a priority.

Pre-computed lists of variants (VUS within ClinVar and unclassified variants exome-wide) with PS1, PM5, and PVS1 evidence are accessible through the following DropBox link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ww082jc6avq1crz/AACJbqy0Db-Ko65ATIYoV0Xca?dl=0
